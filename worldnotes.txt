This file contains various notes about the game and its world. Eventually
this will be transformed into a story or even an in-game readable
encyclopedia. For now these notes remain to storywise explain some of the
design decicions made.

- The area where this game occurs has some strange force field influence in
  it. As a result the gold is twice as heavy as on Earth and uranium and lead
  (the main components of pitchblende) are 4 times as heavy as on Earth. Gold
  is actually a mixture of about 50% gold and 50% water ice so its weight
  appears to be the same as on Earth but it is not.
  This means that a block of pitchblende weights almost 100 tons when loaded
  onboard and thus only a handful of them can be hauled reasonably (unless
  somebody finds a way to construct a drive that has about 100 times of the
  traction than the gravity drive currently in-game).
- This strange force field influence is actually responsible for two more
  things:
  - Maintenance-free uranium based reactors (have you seen one crammed into
    100m3, containment building and all?)
  - The ability to have a ship there that is roughly 3x3x3 meters in
    dimensions yet can cram 4000m3 of stuff into its cargo space. Yet its
    movement is affected by the stuff it contains as if it was much bigger.
  The second thing in this list suggests that the force field has something
  to do with ability to access and utilize more than the usual 3 dimensions
  to make it possible to build huge containers in compact space.
